1. What is a cell address/reference in Excel?
	Unique name of a cell. like A1,A2,....,etc.
	A represents the Column and 1 is the row number.

2. What do you mean by Relative cell referencing and Absolute cell referencing in MS Excel?
	Relative cell reference is a cell address that changes automatically, When we copy a formula to another cell. if you copy a fromul from A3 to B3 and the formula is =A1+A2. So in B3 automatically this formula will be B1+B2
#Excel adjust the reference relative to the new position.
	Absolute cell reference means a cell reference that doesn NOT change.When you copy or drag aformula to another cell. To achieve this we use $ sign. E.g:$A$1

3. How do you freeze panes in Excel?
	Freeze Panes allow row or column to visible while you scroll through the rest of the sheet.
Why do we freeze panes?
Ans: To always see column headings, avoid confusion in large datasets, it makes data analysis easier.
	Select row>> Click on view >> Freeze panes




4. How can you restrict someone from copying a cell from your worksheet?
	by using Protect Sheet option.
	Review >> Protection >> Manage protection >> Protect sheet || Range >> A:D(from A to D is editable)
	*Locked cell cannot be copied or edited.
	* Only allowed cell can be changed and for that we use range.
Note: Excel protection for control not security. It prevents accidental or casual copying.
Protect Workbook means protecting sheet structure, Doesn't protect cell data.

6. Mention the order of operations used in Excel while evaluating formulas.
	Excel follows a fixed rule called 'Operator Precedence'.
	The Order is
		1.Parentheses "()": Operations inside brackets are done first.
		2.Exponents "^": 2^3=8
		3.Multiplication(*) & Division(/):Evaluate left to right.
		4.Addition(+) & Substraction(-): Evaluate left to right.  

8. What is the difference between count, counta, and countblank?
	COUNT:Counts only numeric values(Numbers,Dates,Time Values).
		Formula: =COUNT(range) e.g.: =COUNT(A1:A4)
	COUNTA: Counts all non-empty cells(Num, Text, Dates, 	Formulas(even if results is empty text "")).
		Formula: =COUNTA(range)
	COUNTBLANK: Counts only empty cells. It could be truly blank cells, 			Cell with formulas returning empty text("")
		Formula: =COUNTBLANK(range)


9. What is the shortcut to add a filter to a table?
	Shortcut to add a Filter in Excel is Ctrl+SHIft+L	What this shortcut does: * Adds filter drop-down 	arrows to the header row. *If filters are already 	applied, it removes them(toggle)
	>> Why do we need the filter?
	Filters are used to display only required data from 	a large dataset, making analysis faster and easier 	without changing the original data.

========================================================
10. What is the use of VLOOKUP and how do we use it?

	VLOOKUP is used to find data from a table and return a related value.
	
	=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, FALSE)
	lookup_value → What you are searching for

	table_array → Where Excel should search

	col_index_num → Which column’s value you want

	FALSE → Exact match (important!)
	
=VLOOKUP(102, A2:C5, 3, FALSE)
	Looks for 102
✔ 	Searches in column A
✔ 	Returns value from column 3 (Salary)

Important points to remember

	VLOOKUP searches from top to bottom

	It works left to right only

	Use FALSE for correct results

	Data doesn’t need to be sorted (when FALSE)

===================================================
	
14. How is VLOOKUP different from the LOOKUP function?

LOOKUP is a basic and old function.

	Searches for a value in one row or one column

	Data must be sorted

	Limited control

	Rarely used in real work

VLOOKUP is a more advanced and widely used function.

	Searches vertically (top to bottom)

	Works with unsorted data (using FALSE)

	Can return data from any column to the right

	Used heavily in offices

LOOKUP requires sorted data and has limited use, while VLOOKUP is more flexible and widely used for vertical searches.
===================================================================
15. How many report formats are available in Excel?
	There are 3 report formats in Excel: Compact, Outline, and Tabular.

✅ Report Formats in Excel (Pivot Table)
1️⃣ Compact Form

Default format

All row fields are shown in one column

Saves space

👉 Most commonly used by default

2️⃣ Outline Form

Each field appears in a separate column

Shows hierarchy clearly

Easier to read than Compact

3️⃣ Tabular Form

Data looks like a normal table

Each field has its own column

Best for printing and further analysis

===============================================================
16. How does the IF() function in Excel work?
	The IF() function checks a condition and returns one value if TRUE and another if FALSE.
=IF(A1 >= 40, "Pass", "Fail")

==============================================================
17. How do we use the SUMIF() function in Excel?
	SUMIF() is used to add numbers only when a specific condition is met.

=SUMIF(range, criteria, [sum_range])
Meaning:

range → Where the condition is checked

criteria → The condition

sum_range → What values to add (optional)

==========================================================
19. What is a Pivot Table?
	It turns raw data into useful summaries without writing formulas.

========================================================
26. What are the wildcards available in Excel?
	Excel has three wildcards: asterisk (*), question mark (?), and tilde (~).

1️⃣ Asterisk *

Represents any number of characters (including zero)

Example:

A* → matches Apple, Account, Alex

*ing → matches Running, Coding

2️⃣ Question Mark ?

Represents exactly one character

Example:

T?t → matches Test, Text

A?C → matches ABC, ADC

3️⃣ Tilde ~

Used to escape wildcards (treat them as normal characters)

Example:

~* → finds an actual *

~? → finds an actual ?

=================================================================
27. What is Data Validation? Illustrate with an example.

Data Validation is used to control what type of data a user can enter into a cell.
it prevents wrong data from being entered.

Simple example (Dropdown list)
Suppose you want only these departments:

IT

HR

Finance

Steps:

Select the cell (say A1)

Go to Data → Data Validation

In Allow, choose List

In Source, type:

IT,HR,Finance


Click OK

✅ Now the cell shows a dropdown.
❌ You cannot type any other value.


==========================================================
30. How are nested IF statements used in Excel?
	=IF(condition1, result1,
    IF(condition2, result2,
       IF(condition3, result3, result_if_all_false)))



============================================================
37. How does a Slicer work in Excel?
	A Slicer in Excel is a visual filtering tool that lets you filter data with one click.

What does a Slicer do?

Filters Pivot Tables
Filters Excel Tables
Shows which data is selected
Makes reports interactive


How to use a Slicer (step by step)

Click inside a Pivot Table or Table

Go to Insert → Slicer

Select the column you want to filter (e.g., Department)

Click OK

✅ A slicer box appears with buttons.

41. What is the What-If Analysis in Excel?
What-If Analysis is used to see how changing one or more values affects the final result.

===================================================================
44. How will you pass arguments to VBA Function?
Function AddNumbers(a As Integer, b As Integer) As Integer
    AddNumbers = a + b
End Function
